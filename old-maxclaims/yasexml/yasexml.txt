1 Introduction 
===============

YASEXML is just a very simple, yet grandly effective way of using
s-expressions[1] to represent HTML/XML/SAX type elements and documents..



  (import 'yasexml:<>)




  (princ 
   (<> (paragraph :title "About YASEXML")
     (<> " 
  - Source code itself is human-readable and machine-readable.
  - XML is primarily used to represent data. 
  - Sexps combine source and data.")
     (<> (:text #\Newline))
     (<> "By having a very simple macro, ") (<> b (<> "YASEXML:<>"))
     (<> ", we can add XML and HTML into the very sexp mix.")))




  <paragraph title="About YASEXML"> 
  - Source code itself is human-readable and machine-readable.
  - XML is primarily used to represent data. 
  - Sexps combine source and data.
  By having a very simple macro, <b>YASEXML:&lt;&gt;</b>, we can add XML and HTML into the very sexp mix.</paragraph>

2 Example Use 
==============

2.1 HTML pages 
---------------

Since a lot of interfaces these days are web based, and the data
language used to markup web pages, HTML, is nearly identical to
XML/XHTML, ours YASEXML works great to generate such things.

Let us say we have a list of strings, and we simply want to generate a
=ul= with =li='s:



  (<> (:handler (closure-html:make-string-sink))
    (<> ul (dolist (i '(this is a big olde list of items)) 
             (<> li (<> (:text i))))))




  <ul><li>THIS</li><li>IS</li><li>A</li><li>BIG</li><li>OLDE</li><li>LIST</li><li>OF</li><li>ITEMS</li></ul>



Because of that, we can sort of meta-circularly use YASEXML to display
it's own =CL:DOCUMENTATION=.



  (import 'yasexml:<>)
  (let ((docs (documentation '<> 'function)))
    (<> pre (<> (:text docs))))


*RESULTS:*



  <pre>=&gt; /whatever &amp;body returns/
  Example : (&lt;&gt; (:handler (cxml:make-string-sink
                       :indentation 1))
             (&lt;&gt; (test-tag :test-attribute "test-attribute-value")
               (&lt;&gt; "Test Text as Tag" (&lt;&gt; (br)))
               (&lt;&gt; (:text "Test :TEXT as Tag") 
                 (&lt;&gt; ("foo bar=baz" :bat "?"))
                 (&lt;&gt; (:text "Test " ":TEXT" "many strings"))
                 (&lt;&gt; `(:text ,(concatenate 
                               'string "Test " ":TEXT "
                                "many strings with backquote " 
                                "and concatenate" ))
                   (&lt;&gt; `(,(funcall (constantly 'backquoted-tag-name))
                          ,@(list 'list "attribute")))))))
               
  "&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;test-tag test-attribute="test-attribute-value"&gt;
   Test Text as Tag
   &lt;br/&gt;
   Test :TEXT as Tag
   &lt;foo bar=baz bat="?"/&gt;
   Test
   :TEXT
   many strings
   Test :TEXT many strings with backquote and concatenate
   &lt;backquoted-tag-name list="attribute"/&gt;
  &lt;/test-tag&gt;"</pre>


[1] ORG-BLOCKQUOTE-START
s-expressions, sexprs or sexps (for "symbolic expression") are a
notation for nested list (tree-structured) data, invented for and
popularized by the programming language Lisp, which uses them for
source code as well as data.
